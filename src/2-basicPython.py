# A float (rationale Zahl) can have digits after
# the decimal point while an integer doesn't (ganze zahl)

# text (string)

# a list of elements enclosed in [ ]
c = [4,3,2,1]

# can be address with an index
# all indices start from 0, by default
print("First element of variable c is: ",c[0],", type is ",type(c[0]))

# we can use another variable as index
d = 3
print("Element ",d," of variable c is: ",c[d],", type is ",type(c[d]))

# if we use an invalid index, python will be unhappy
#print("Element 5 of variable c is: ",c[5])
# it's better to comment this code out by placing a "#"
# at the start of the line

# we can iterate of all elements in a list in different ways
# with a for loop:
for i in range(0,4):
    print("Element ",i,": ",c[i])
# Please note three things here:
#   1) the range 0,4 seems to covers 5 elements,
#   but the last one is NOT included
#   2) the line with the condition (control statement) ends with ":"
#   3) the following line is indented
# This holds in general for all control structures in python

# Alternatively, we can use the "in" operator
for cc in c:
    print("Element is : ",cc)
# Again, we have the ":" and the indentation
# This time, we don't have an explicit index
# but we don't need to check the index range any more
# less errors!

# the brakcets, the function sould work upon. We often call these things
# in brackets "function parameters"
# Many function don't only take parameters as inputs, they also return
# values, very obviously seen with the "input()" function
# Many functions are written by other people and are available
# in libraries or modules (naming depends on language)
# we can define out own functions too, like so:
# def <name>(<params>):
